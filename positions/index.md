*Updated Jan 4, 2016*

We are now accepting applications for the following position.

####About the position
The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC) acts as a center for bioinformatics research, services and training at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Integral to the Harvard Chan School, the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center and Harvard Medical School, our multi-disciplinary team works with researchers across the Harvard, MIT and Broad biomedical community, providing a comprehensive portfolio of infrastructure, data analysis, training and development. We seek an experienced computational biologist to become a key member of our team.

This is a unique opportunity to participate in world-class research that aims to make an impact on human health. As part of the HBC, you will be working directly with researchers on projects ranging from blood stem cell epigenetics to clinical grade sequencing of patient genomes to HIV resistance studies. This is a great opportunity to learn from other experienced bioinformaticians and to work within a cohesive, interactive team.

####About you
You have a background in biomedical or quantitative science and a strong interest in working with researchers in biomedical research and public health. You thrive on scientific challenges, enjoy collaborating with an interdisciplinary team and excel at communicating and coordinating between programmers and wet-lab scientists alike. Learning and applying new methods is natural for you, and you are motivated to continuously expand your skills. You have a good handle on your data and project management skills. Working on different projects and deadlines, frequently in collaboration with other Cores and research groups, doesn’t intimidate you.

####The details
You will support researchers in the Harvard community with their data management, quality control, analysis of data and presentation of results. Projects are usually a mix of short-term support tasks and long-term collaborations; most support tasks and methods should eventually transition into standardized workflows. You will need broad experience in several bioinformatics domains such as microarray analysis (expression, methylation), sequencing (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, genome assembly, exome/WGS sequencing) or functional analysis and know how to implement your analyses in reproducible workflows. You will be expected to coordinate selected research or support projects and act as an independent point of contact for researchers.

####Basic qualifications
- PhD in a biomedical or quantitative science (or equivalent experience), 2+ years of work experience
- Expertise in at least one listed bioinformatics domain
- Evidence of working directly with wet laboratories to perform analyses
- Working knowledge of biology, genetics and cell biology
- Proven ability to interpret and analyze large data sets and present results synthetically
- Excellent written English and a familiarity with presenting biological results
- Strong interpersonal skills
- Computational experience
	- Scripting abilities (Perl, Python)
	- Experience with R/BioC
	- Working knowledge of high performance computing cluster systems

####Additional qualifications
- Familiarity with best practices in different sequencing workflows
- Competency in statistics


####Contact us
Please apply before **February 2016** via email with a **CV and cover letter to [John Hutchinson](mailto:jhutchin@hsph.harvard.edu) using 'HBC position’ as the subject line**. This is a one year appointment with the possibility of renewal. Preference will be given to individuals with a background in NGS data analysis and familiarity with high performance compute environments.
