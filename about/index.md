The HSPH Bioinformatics Core (HBC) is integral to the development and application of computational biology methods at the School.

### Mission

HBC provides a single point of contact for Harvard researchers interested in bioinformatics support, applying genomic approaches together with established and developing methodologies from epidemiology, environmental health, biostatistics and bioinformatics to improve human health.

[Core staff](/people) aid researchers within the Harvard community with the management, integration and contextual analysis of biological high-throughput data, focusing on next-generation sequencing support. We [provide consulting, training, tools, databases and best practices](/services), foster collaboration and a community of bioinformatics activities, and build a unified infrastructure supporting a diverse set of experimental systems and high-throughput biological data.


### Affiliations and Funding

HBC collaborates with other bioinformatics cores and research groups to provide you with an optimal service. We work closely with our colleagues in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/departments/biostatistics/) and the [Program in Quantitative Genomics](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/pqg/).

The Core is a member of the [Environmental Statistics and Bioinformatics Core](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/niehs/facility-cores/environmental-statistics-and-bioinformatics-core/index.html) at the Harvard NIEHS Center for Environmental Health and serves as the [Harvard Catalyst Bioinformatics Consulting group](http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/bioinformaticsconsult/). As part of the [Center for Stem Cell Bioinformatics](http://stemcellcommons.hsci.harvard.edu/) HBC extends its services to members of the HSCI community. Through funding from the [Tools and Technology group](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments/tools-and-technology) and the [Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center](http://www.neurodiscovery.harvard.edu/), we can also offer help to researchers at Harvard Medical School.

We are receiving additional funding through the [Cure Alzheimer's Fund](http://www.curealzfund.org/), NIH and DARPA grants and industry support. 



### Partners

Additional partners include the [Center for Cancer Computational Biology](http://cccb.dfci.harvard.edu/) (DFCI), the [Bioinformatics & Research Computing group](http://jura.wi.mit.edu/bio/) (Whitehead) and the [Galaxy team](http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/). All computational resources are located at the [FAS Research Computing Center](http://rc.fas.harvard.edu/), with additional resources being managed by the [HMS Research Computing Group](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/).
