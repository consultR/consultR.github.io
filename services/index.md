ConsultR consultants can elevate your data analytics capabilities, expand your team's knowledge with cutting edge machine learning techniques and optimize your efficiency by leveraging the most popular programming language for data science, **R**. We have three core services and the potential availability to conduct small corporate trainings. We utilize open-source software tools RStudio, Git and GitHub to offer transparency and reproducible data analyses.
 
 
#### 1. Shiny web app development: 

> Shiny is a web application framework for R, requiring no advanced knowledge of web development tools.

We have experience developing and conceptualizing shiny apps for various industries including: 
- [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/jasdumas/shinyGEO)
- [Education](https://ct-data-collaborative.github.io/shiny-server/index.html)
- [Public Safety](https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/hartford-crime/)
- [Real Estate](https://jasdumas.github.io/tech-short-papers/flex-realestate.html)

Let us assist you making your app user-friendly with advanced bootstrap components, or turn your static graphics into dynamic interactive visualizations with reactive widgets.

#### 2. Predictive analytics:

> The analysis of data is a process of exploring, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, adding business value, and supporting decision-making.

We can provide end-to-end data science services with a emphasis on predictive modeling and machine learning. Let us assist you in turning unstructured text data into actionable insights by gleaning implicit sentiment from surveys. Looking to improve your model's performance, let us advise on **feature engineering, pre-processing, sampling techniques and evaluation metrics**.


#### 3. Data Science Architecture:

> "When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function. When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post" - Dave Robinson, Chief Data Scientist at DataCamp ([@drob](https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440))

We can support the development of transitioning inefficient scripts into functions for research manuscripts and R packages. Let us develop and review your submission to The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), the central repository for R software to ensure timely public release of your open source tooling.
