Core staff can handle all your bioinformatics needs in array and sequence analysis, from data retrieval and management, storage, quality control, analysis and writeup. We follow best practices and re-use public workflows and tools wherever possible, but are happy to adapt existing methods and develop new solutions where required. While we can offer support in most areas of computational biology HBC’s expertise is focused on three core areas:

#### 1. Next generation sequencing analysis: 

Core analysts have extensive experience in [managing and analyzing sequencing data](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.org/), including whole genome and exome sequencing (quality control, mapping, re-alignment, variant calls, prioritization), RNA-seq (quantification and _de novo_ transcriptome analysis), genome assembly (reference guided and _de novo_) and epigenomics. We can also provide support in the design and and analysis of your customized NGS experiment.

#### 2. Functional analysis:

We can provide a path from genes to function by delivering extensive functional annotation, prioritizing new markers and developing testable hypotheses for future experiments. We test for functional information using different gene set enrichment approaches (using Gene Ontology, pathway databases as well as curated and generic gene sets), provide context by integrating your data with public resources such as [GEO](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and [ArrayExpress](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/), and explore the biological interaction space in co-expression and high-throughput interaction data sets using network analysis techniques.

#### 3. Research computing support:

Due to our collaboration with the [FAS Research Computing](https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/) team we can also help with more general problems of computational infrastructure to optimally support your project, including data storage, backup, server setup and access to [Odyssey](https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/odyssey/), a high performance cluster with more than 50.000 cores.

## Working with us

HBC works as a recharge center. Consults are billed at $125/hour after an initial meeting to discuss your project. This model ensures that we can flexibly assign the right combination of expertise to your specific tasks. We will provide you with a estimate of the number of hours required, a quote and a start date as part of our [Memorandum of Understanding](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/407047/Ghost/hbc/CHB%20MOU.pdf) (PDF). During the project you will receive detailed monthly billing updates and ongoing analysis results via our project page.

We can support grant proposals on short notice. The Core’s team has extensive experience in providing standard descriptions and implementing best practices in data management, user and security handling, quality controls and data dissemination to the scientific community that fulfill NIH and NSF requirements and simplify the process of publishing your manuscript.

Fees for pilot projects and other short term consults can be subsidized in many cases through support from our funders (Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School Tools and Technology, Harvard School of Public Health NIEHS, Harvard CFAR and Harvard Catalyst). If in doubt [ask us for more information](/contact)!
