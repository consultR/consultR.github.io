title: "Training"
---

With funding from the HMS Tools and Technology Committee, the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center (HNDC) and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) we have a dedicated bioinformatics training program for:

- HMS researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad 

- researchers with an affiliation with the HNDC

- HSCI researchers 

---

We **provide bioinformatics training** through both workshops and in-depth courses.
*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*


#### 1. Workshops 

##### a. Next Generation Sequencing Introduction Series
([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

##### b. Basic Bioinformatics Skills Series
Topics include R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (duration varies from half a day to three days).

#### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses
These intensive courses run for 10-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([Orchestra](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis
