With funding from the HMS Tools and Technology Committee, the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center (HNDC) and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) we have a dedicated bioinformatics training program for:

- HMS researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad 

- researchers with an affiliation with the HNDC

- HSCI researchers 

*In addition, we also teach short courses for [Harvard Catalyst](http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/bioinformatics-workshops/).*

### Upcoming workshops/courses:

#### For HSCI, HNDC and on-quad HMS researchers

* **April 3rd and 4th, 2017: *Introduction to R***

  This 2-day hands-on workshop will introduce participants to using R and RStudio. After this workshop participants can expect to be comfortable with the basics of data manipulation and plotting using R.
  
  ** *Registration will open on March 13th, 2017* **
  
* **May 24th and 25th, 2017: *Introduction to UNIX and RNA-Seq***
  
	This 2-day hands-on workshop will introduce participants to the command-line interface, compute clusters, and basic methods to get started with RNA-Seq data analysis.
  
  ** *Registration will open on May 3rd, 2017* **
  
* **June 6th - July 13th, 2017: *In-depth NGS data analysis course***
  
  This 12-day in-depth course will instruct participants on the theoretical and practical concepts related to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis, enabling them to perform these analyses independently.
  
  ** *Registration will open on April 7th, 2017* **
	 
#### For HNDC researchers only

* **April 20th, 2017: *Introduction to R***

  This 1-day hands-on workshop will introduce participants to using R and RStudio. After this workshop participants can expect to be comfortable with the basics of data manipulation using R.
  
  ** *Registration will open on March 30th, 2017* **

### Training program description:

We provide bioinformatics training through both **shorter workshops** and **in-depth courses**. [[Click here](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/training/#upcoming-workshopscourses) for a list of upcoming workshops/courses, or scroll down.]

#### 1. Workshops 

* **Next Generation Sequencing Introduction Series**

	([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

* **Basic Bioinformatics Skills Series**	

	Topics include R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (duration varies from half a day to three days).

#### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses

These intensive courses run for 10-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning **how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses**. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([Orchestra](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis

*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*
