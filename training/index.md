With funding from the HMS Tools and Technology Committee, the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center (HNDC) and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) we have a dedicated bioinformatics training program for:

- HMS researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad 

- researchers with an affiliation with the HNDC

- HSCI researchers 

---

We **provide bioinformatics training** through both workshops and in-depth courses.
*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*


#### 1. Workshops 

##### a. Next Generation Sequencing Introduction Series
These are One-day ([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) [NGS workshops](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/) on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of NGS analysis using the easy point-and-click Galaxy interface. The goal of these workshops are to enableresearchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

##### b. Basic Bioinformatics Skills Series
These workshops address multiple topics including R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (varies from half a day to three days) 

#### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses
These intensive courses run for 10-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses. Topics include:

- using Unix & High performance compute environments 

- Software Carpentry-based introduction to R and version control with Git

- NGS analysis (command-line based, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Exome-Seq and Variant calling)

- Downstream functional analysis

- Data visualization with genome browsers
