With funding from the HMS Tools and Technology Committee, the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center (HNDC) and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) we have a dedicated bioinformatics training program for:

- HMS researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad 
- researchers with an affiliation with the HNDC
- HSCI researchers 

*In addition, we also teach short courses for [Harvard Catalyst](http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/bioinformatics-workshops/).*

***

### Upcoming workshops/courses:

Please find a list of our various offerings below categorized by eligibility. If you would like to receive emails from us about training opportunities, please fill out [this form](https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6nGqk2i8RUi2oN7). 

#### For HSCI, HNDC and on-quad HMS researchers
  
* January 29th - 31st, 2018: *Introduction to RNA-seq using high-performance computing*. 

**Registration is now open!** More information and a link to register is available at [https://tinyurl.com/rnaseq-hpc-2018](https://tinyurl.com/rnaseq-hpc-2018).

#### Harvard Catalyst Workshops

* April 5th, 6th, 12th and 13th, 2018: *Introduction to R: Basics, Plots, and RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis* [Registration will open in early 2018]

***

#### For all researchers at Harvard University and affiliated institutions

We are excited to announce a *new workshop series* called **"Current Topics in Bioinformatics"**. 

Each of these **2 to 3 hour**, **hands-on** workshops are freestanding, but some of them will have prerequisites. They will be held **monthly** in the Longwood Medical Area at either HSPH or HMS. Please **bring a laptop with [R](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed** to be able to follow along in class; for additional installation instructions for each class, please click on the links in the table below. The workshops are first-come-first-served and there is no registration process, so we encourage you to be punctual! 

**Spring 2018 schedule will be announced in mid-January 2018**

**Fall 2017 schedule and lesson links:**

### Training program description:

We provide bioinformatics training through both **shorter workshops** and **in-depth courses**. [[Click here](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/training/#upcoming-workshopscourses) for a list of upcoming workshops/courses]

#### 1. Workshops 

* **Next Generation Sequencing Introduction Series**

	([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

* **Basic Bioinformatics Skills Series**	

	Topics include R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (duration varies from half a day to three days).

#### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses

These intensive courses run for 10-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning **how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses**. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([Orchestra](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis

*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*
